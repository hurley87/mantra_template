                  This Privacy Policy was written to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your information. Since technology and privacy laws are always changing, we may occasionally update this policy. If a significant change is made, we will be sure to post a notice on our home page and in the tutor admin. If you continue to use Pttrns after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
